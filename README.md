üåç *Global Defense Expenditure and Economic Development Analysis* üìä



I am thrilled to share my latest project, "Global Defense Expenditure and Economic Development Analysis," which dives deep into the intricate relationship between defense spending and the economic trajectories of countries across the globe.



In this project, I analyzed data on global defense budgets, GDP growth rates, and other economic indicators from 2015 to 2022. The objective was to explore how varying levels of military expenditure impact national economies, and vice versa.



üìà *Key Insights*:

- *Military Expenditure Trends*: Analysis of how countries prioritize defense budgets as a percentage of GDP, and how these trends shift regionally.

- *Economic Impact*: Identifying the correlation between defense spending and GDP growth, investigating if higher military spending spurs or suppresses economic development.

- *Regional Focus*: Comparing defense budgets by regions such as Asia, Europe, North America, and others to understand defense priorities across the world.

- *Predictive Modeling*: Utilizing machine learning models like Linear Regression to predict future defense budgets based on historical data and economic variables.

- *Time-Series Forecasting*: Implementing ARIMA models for forecasting future trends in defense spending, helping to predict how nations might allocate resources in the future.

  

Through various statistical tools, visualizations, and predictive models, this project sheds light on the nuanced relationship between a nation's defense expenditure and its economic growth. Whether countries are investing more in their defense due to geopolitical tensions or focusing on economic expansion, this analysis highlights the trade-offs and long-term effects of such decisions.



üí° *Technologies Used*:

- *Python*: For data processing, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

- *Machine Learning*: Linear Regression for predictive modeling.

- *Data Visualization*: Seaborn and Matplotlib for detailed graphical analysis.

- *Time-Series Analysis*: ARIMA models for forecasting.



üîç *Takeaway*: This project can be a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and analysts aiming to make informed decisions on defense budgets and their potential economic impacts.



I am excited to continue expanding this analysis and exploring new dimensions of how global defense strategies align with economic goals.
